        <h1>Understanding Personality</h1>
        <p>
          Personality is the distinct set of traits, behaviors, and emotional patterns that define an individualâ€™s way of thinking and interacting with the world. It shapes how people respond to different situations, build relationships, and make decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While some aspects of personality are influenced by genetics, life experiences and environmental factors also play a crucial role in shaping who we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychologists have developed various theories to explain personality, with one of the most widely recognized being the <strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</strong>. This model categorizes individuals into 16 personality types based on cognitive functions, helping people better understand their tendencies, strengths, and areas for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding personality can offer valuable insights into self-awareness, communication styles, and personal development. It helps individuals recognize their natural inclinations, improve interactions with others, and make informed decisions about their careers and relationships.
